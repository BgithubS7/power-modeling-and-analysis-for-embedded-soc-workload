# ðŸ”‹ Power Modeling and Analysis for Embedded SoC Workloads

This project provides a complete framework to **model**, **measure**, and **visualize** the power consumption of embedded SoC (CPU/MCU) systems under different workloads and operating modes. It combines analytical modeling with real-time empirical data collection using low-cost power sensors.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Model theoretical power profiles of embedded SoC systems.
- Log real-time current, voltage, and power data during various operations.
- Visualize power usage and energy consumption over time.
- Provide insights into workload efficiency and power optimization.
